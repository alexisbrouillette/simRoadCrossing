# Optimizing fences position for animal road crossing
This project was inspired by the work of Wilansky and Jaeger from this paper https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380024001728.

The goal was to use a genetic algorithm to find optimal fences positions to minimise animal loss when they cross roads.
